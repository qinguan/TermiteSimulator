hello!
I have to design a simulator that will maintain an environment, which consists of a collection of patches arranged in a rectangular grid of arbitrary size. Each patch contains zero or more wood chips. A patch may be occupied by one or more workertermites or soldiertermites, which are mobile entities that live within the world and behave according to simple rules.

A WORKERTERMITE can pick up a wood chip from the patch that it is currently on, or drop a wood chip that it is carrying when the patch has a wood. Termites travel around the grid by moving randomly from their current patch to a neighbouring patch, in one of eight possible directions.

A SOLDIERTERMITE moves in a similar way to termites.
